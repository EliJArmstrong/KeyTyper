Roses are red, violets are blue, I'm a good typer and so are you. Eli Armstrong/
You fit into me, like a hook into an eye, a fish hook, an open eye. Margaret Atwood/
The rose is a rose, And was always a rose. But the theory now goes That the apple’s a rose, And the pear is, and so’s The plum, I suppose. The dear only knows What will next prove a rose. You, of course, are a rose – But were always a rose. Robert Frost/
Everyday somewhere in the world another unsung hero is born. Someone who is willing, to lay his life on the line to save another living creature, on this wonderful planet of ours. To go out of their way, and risk life and limb to save something, from danger and certain death. These unsung heroes don’t want medals, glory or even fame. In fact, most would walk away afterwards, without anyone ever knowing their name. It is not that they feel guilty. They just feel that they haven’t done anything that is special or something someone else wouldn’t have probably done. Therefore, to all those unsung heroes this poem is just for you. For all the lives that you save each and every day. David Harris
